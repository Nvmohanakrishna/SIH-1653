## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea

### 1. Candidate Dashboard
A personalized dashboard where candidates can track their interview schedules, view feedback, and access preparation resources. It helps candidates stay organized and in control throughout the interview process.

### 2. Real-Time Interview Notifications
Real-time notifications keep candidates and interviewers informed about any changes in schedules, upcoming interviews, or new feedback. It ensures both parties are always up to date with the latest updates.

### 3. Interview Feedback System
This system allows interviewers to provide detailed feedback and scores based on candidate performance. It enhances the interview experience by fostering transparency and improvement.

### 4. AI-Driven Question & Answer Generation
AI-powered question generation ensures that each interview is tailored to the candidateâ€™s background and expertise. This guarantees relevant, dynamic questioning for a personalized experience.

### 5. Virtual Interview Room
The virtual interview room includes video conferencing, screen sharing, and collaborative note-taking features. It replicates a real-life interview environment for an immersive experience.

### 6. Candidate Skill Assessment Tools
Candidates can complete tailored skill assessments relevant to the job role. These tests offer an interactive and quantifiable way to showcase their abilities during the interview process.

### 7. Interviewer Ratings and Feedback
After interviews, candidates can rate their interviewers and provide constructive feedback. This creates a feedback loop that helps maintain high standards and transparency.

### 8. Job Matching and Recommendations
An AI-driven system matches candidates to relevant job roles based on their qualifications and interview performance. It ensures that candidates are recommended positions that align with their skills.

### 9. Document Sharing and Storage
A secure system for candidates to upload and share necessary documents like resumes and certificates. It simplifies the document exchange process and ensures accessibility for interviewers.

### 10. Mock Interview & Practice Sessions
Candidates can practice mock interviews with AI or community-based interviewers. This helps build confidence and refine interview skills in a controlled, realistic setting.
